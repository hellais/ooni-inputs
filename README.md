# What is this?

This repository is meant for collecting URLs of sites to be tested for
censorship with OONI.

If you have lists of sites to be tested please send a git pull request.

When dumping files that don't have a proper structure, please put them in the
directory raw/.
In the directory processed/ should only be lists that contain one URL per line
in this format:

    http://example.com/
